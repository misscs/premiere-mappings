## Camera Settings Information 

First clip determines the settings

Set sequence to highest setting (ex. If you have a mix of 4k and web clips, set to 4k)

## Camera Settings

* 100M is best; 50M is required for most broadcasts
* Ask when producing video for others (different companies have different requirements, also varies by country)
* 24p for more cinematic look
* Use higher frame rate for action or when you want to use slow motion
    * 60p or higher

* Interlace produces ia more digital look
* Progress is more cinematic


## 4k video, aye or nay?

* Advantage to 4k is ability to crop
* Disadvantage is size of files/computer capabilities 
* Create proxy files on computer if editing gets too slow
